# Kenny's dotfiles
The structure here *should* replicate that of my home folder (`~/`).

This README also contains some notes about the setup of some programs.

The ArchWiki has a nice article about dotfiles:
- https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dotfiles

## Git
A script to generate the tracked `.gitconfig` can be found at `generate-git-config.sh`.

## Sublime Text
I usually install the following packages via Package Control:
- INI
- Print to HTML
- TrailingSpaces
