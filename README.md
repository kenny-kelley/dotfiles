# Kenny's dotfiles
The structure here *should* replicate that of my home folder (`~/`).

The ArchWiki has a nice article about dotfiles, which can be found here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dotfiles

I run `./copy-in-dotfiles.sh` to import things that I care about.

It also contains some other small, helpful scripts.
